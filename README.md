# FLEX+IR
Code implementation of Fluctuatiopn Exchange (FLEX) approximation within the [intermediate representation (IR) basis](https://github.com/SpM-lab/irbasis). Details on the method and its applicability can be found in N. Witt, E. G. C. P. van Loon, T. Nomoto, R. Arita, T. Wehling, [Phys. Rev. B 103, 205148 (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.103.205148).

At the current stage, the code is poorly commented/documented. I will work on this in the future, but like in its current state it can be freely used by the scientific community. Please give credit accordingly. Feel free to ask me any questions you might have regarding the code.
